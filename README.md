# open_production_rules
Also called Modern development standards

You may want to know what is open_production_rules.

**The first function:**
it will introduce many coder use coding tool for a better code quality and productivity.

code, linux, gpg, ssh-key, many things.

**The second function:**

It has many test methods and production process control.
There are some rules while the Manufacturer must obey, and also other things which is optional.

I first let you know, some VCS as git will hold many branches in a developing flow, such as main, bugfix, lts, feature.
You may notice there are some software which provide a Preview version.

The difference from main version and preview version is not only about the old and the new, is also about a product going to be a hard test flow and, the statistics data will claim that, a main version is a function safety version. And it can be apply in a very dangerous area for low risk scenario.

A coder product is a source code, and we make test standards to control the risk of the code.

lts -- often for very low risk and very old, and very many test standards experience.
main -- often for low risk and old.
unstable -- often for high risk and new.
